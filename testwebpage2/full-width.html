        <p>Animal Observer is an iPad application specifically developed to help behavioral ecologists collect focal-follow and scan data on social animals. It can also be used to record several types of ad libitum data. Animal Observer includes a default data collection protocol and a few gorilla group composition data which you can use to practice and assess if the App meets your needs. Feel free to sample it and test the following features and procedures:
<ul>
  <li>Enter your pin code and the app will start a new session. On the first screen you can select session-specific variables. The only required variable you must select is the social group. All other variables may be customized and are optional. Default variables include the observer name and observer type.</li>
  <li>Select the social group you want to study during the session. More than one group can be studied in the same session, just select each group and make sure a check mark appears by each one. Double tap on the individual’s images to zoom in. Add additional individuals using the + button at the end of the image list.</li>
  <li>Tap "Confirm Settings" and the focal settings page will appear. Select an individual, a focal duration and a scan interval for your observation. Enter any focal-specific variable you would like. The default version only has one such variable (Data usage) but this can be customized to fit anyone’s specific observation needs.</li>
  <li>Press "Start Focal" and proceed with the first scan. Drag individuals from the left panel (ID bank) to the scene and place them wherever you see them around the focal individual. Tap on the individuals you want to record activities for. Recorded activities can be customized.
    <ul>
      <li>To select several individuals at the same time, tap twice on the scene and on the second tap, draw a circle around these individuals.</li>	
      <li>The x,y position of each individual is recorded at the end of the scan. If Map Mode is off, the focal individual has the coordinates {0,0} and the other individuals' coordinates are expressed in meters in relation to the focal individual. If Map Mode is on, the origin of the coordinate system is the lower left corner of the background map. Read more about Map Mode in the Current Features section.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Enter scan-specific variables on the bottom left panel and finish your scan. Scan-specific variables can be customized. If Use Compass is on, you can then enter the bearing of the focal individual. Read more about Use Compass in the Current Features section.</li>
  <li>During the interval between scans, you can enter social behavior data and move individuals on the scene. The movements are not recorded until the moment of the scan, and the location of each individual on the scene is only a tool to help with animal identification and to prepare the next scan.
    <ul>
    	<li>To enter social interaction data, lock the "move" switch and drag your finger between two individuals. If the behavioral is directional (e.g. grooming, dominance interactions), make sure you drag from the actor to the subject. This type of data can be useful for dyadic interaction studies, for example aggression landscapes or avoidance patterns.</li>
    	<li>To enter individual-specific data, double tap on an individual and follow the list of options. Such data may include self-directed behaviors (self-grooming and self-playing) or information such as health data.</li>
    	<li>Dyadic interaction data and individual-specific data can be edited by tapping on the edit button at the top right corner of the screen. Comments can then be added to specific behaviors.</li>
    	<li>All three types of pop-up menus (dyadic interaction, individual activities recorded during scans and individual-specific data) can be customized with your unique variables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If your focal animal disappears, just tap the scene with two fingers. The scene will turn red and the time stamp and GPS location will be recorded. Tap again with two fingers when the animal is back in view. You can actually use this feature for something else than "animal out-of-view/back-in-view". A customizable note is saved each time you use the two-finger tap gesture. If an individual that is not the focal leaves the scene, the individual can be returned to the ID bank by dragging and dropping their icon to the bank. Read more about GPS in the Current Features section.</li>
  <li>If unknown or unidentified individuals are at the scene, they can be represented by the UNK and UNID icons from the ID bank. Each addition of UNK or UNID results with the icons being subscripted with numbers. If a previously UNK or UNID individual is recognized, click the Rename button and tap the newly identified UNID/UNK for a list of known individuals to choose from. Incorrectly identified individuals can be renamed in the same way.</li>
  <li>If an individual, behavior, or time stamp is incorrectly recorded, the entry can be changed by tapping on the specific mistake entry and modifying it to the correct information. This method only works on the entry selected and will not affect the other data entries. The time stamp can only be changed to a time within the scan period; the app will reject any time before or after the selected interval. If the time stamp is changed, the entry will remain in its previous chronological place and can be sorted into the correct chronological place by tapping the Sort Table button.</li>
