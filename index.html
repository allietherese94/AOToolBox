<p><strong>Animal Observer</strong> is an iOS application adapted for iPad and iPad mini. It allows users to collect behavioral data in the field or in captivity, but can also be used to record health data or any other individual-specific data. The current beta-version of <strong>Animal Observer</strong> is currently used by Fossey Fund scientists studying gorillas in Rwanda and Congo. The application will be made available to the public on the Apple App Store in April 2015. </p>

<a id="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Use</h3>

<p><strong>Animal Observer</strong> is an iPad application specifically developed to help behavioral ecologists collect focal-follow and scan data on social animals. It can also be used to record several types of ad libitum data. <strong>Animal Observer</strong> includes a default data collection protocol and a few gorilla group composition data which you can use to practice and assess if the App meets your needs. Feel free to sample it and test the following features and procedures:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Enter your pin code and the app will start a new session. On the first screen you can select session-specific variables. The only required variable you must select is the social group. All other variables may be customized and are optional. Default variables include the observer name and observer type.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the social group you want to study during the session. More than one group can be studied in the same session, just select each group and make sure a check mark appears by each one. Double tap on the individual’s images to zoom in. Add additional individuals using the + button at the end of the image list.</p></li>
<li><p>Tap "Confirm Settings" and the focal settings page will appear. Select an individual, a focal duration and a scan interval for your observation. Enter any focal-specific variable you would like. The default version only has one such variable (Data usage) but this can be customized to fit anyone’s specific observation needs. </p></li>
<li>
<p>Press "Start Focal" and proceed with the first scan. Drag individuals from the left panel (ID bank) to the scene and place them wherever you see them around the focal individual. Tap on the individuals you want to record activities for. Recorded activities can be customized. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>To select several individuals at the same time, tap twice on the scene and on the second tap, draw a circle around these individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>The x,y position of each individual is recorded at the end of the scan. If Map Mode is off, the focal individual has the coordinates {0,0} and the other individuals' coordinates are expressed in meters in relation to the focal individual. If Map Mode is on, the origin of the coordinate system is the lower left corner of the background map. Read more about Map Mode in the <a href="#cfheader">Current Features</a> section. </p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Enter scan-specific variables on the bottom left panel and finish your scan. Scan-specific variables can be customized. If Use Compass is on, you can then enter the bearing of the focal individual. Read more about Use Compass in the <a href="#cfheader">Current Features</a> section.</p></li>
<li>
<p>During the interval between scans, you can enter social behavior data and move individuals on the scene. The movements are not recorded until the moment of the scan, and the location of each individual on the scene is only a tool to help with animal identification and to prepare the next scan. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>To enter social interaction data, lock the "move" switch and drag your finger between two individuals. If the behavioral is directional (e.g. grooming, dominance interactions), make sure you drag from the actor to the subject. This type of data can be useful for dyadic interaction studies, for example aggression landscapes or avoidance patterns. </p></li>
<li><p>To enter individual-specific data, double tap on an individual and follow the list of options. Such data may include self-directed behaviors (self-grooming and self-playing) or information such as health data.</p></li>
<li><p>Dyadic interaction data and individual-specific data can be edited by tapping on the edit button at the top right corner of the screen. Comments can then be added to specific behaviors. </p></li>
<li><p>All three types of pop-up menus (dyadic interaction, individual activities recorded during scans and individual-specific data) can be customized with your unique variables.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If your focal animal disappears, just tap the scene with two fingers. The scene will turn red and the time stamp and GPS location will be recorded. Tap again with two fingers when the animal is back in view. You can actually use this feature for something else than "animal out-of-view/back-in-view". A customizable note is saved each time you use the two-finger tap gesture. If an individual that is not the focal leaves the scene, the individual can be returned to the ID bank by dragging and dropping their icon to the bank. Read more about GPS in the <a href="#cfheader">Current Features</a> section. </p></li>
<li><p>If unknown or unidentified individuals are at the scene, they can be represented by the UNK and UNID icons from the ID bank. Each addition of UNK or UNID results with the icons being subscripted with numbers. If a previously UNK or UNID individual is recognized, click the Rename button and tap the newly identified UNID/UNK for a list of known individuals to choose from. Incorrectly identified individuals can be renamed in the same way.</p></li>
<li><p>If an individual, behavior, or time stamp is incorrectly recorded, the entry can be changed by tapping on the specific mistake entry and modifying it to the correct information. This method only works on the entry selected and will not affect the other data entries. The time stamp can only be changed to a time within the scan period; the app will reject any time before or after the selected interval. If the time stamp is changed, the entry will remain in its previous chronological place and can be sorted into the correct chronological place by tapping the Sort Table button. </p></li>
</ul>

<a id="current-features" class="anchor" href="#current-features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="cfheader"></a>Current Features</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>User-Specific Pin Codes: If several users share the same device, each user can have an individual pin code. Pin codes can be any four digit number.</p></li>
<li><p>GPS Feature: If GPS is turned on, the app will record a GPS coordinate (lat., long., alt., precision) each time a new behavior is recorded, each time a scan is recorded and each time a text comment is entered. Not all iPads are GPS enabled, and if you use the app in the field, we recommend pairing these iPads with a bluetooth GPS. Several models exist, and Fossey Fund currently uses the Garmin GLO which works well (although it's not waterproof). The GPS however is not necessary for Animal Observer to function. </p></li>
<li><p>Use Compass Feature: If you turn this feature on, you will be able to enter the compass bearing of the focal individual at the end of each scan. Combined with the GPS data, this feature can be used to calculate the lat/long coordinates of all the individuals you are observing. This type of data can then be used to study individual movement patterns (who is at the front of the group, who walks behind...etc). It cannot be used if Map Mode is activated. </p></li>
<li><p>Map Mode: In this mode, the typical background (target with circles at varying distances) is replaced by an image in .png or .jpg format. If this image is a map of a small study area (e.g., forest clearing visited by gorillas, enclosure in a sanctuary or a zoo), you will be able to use your scan data to look at which areas of your map are used most or least frequently by your study individuals or groups. The map’s default units are meters, but this is customizable. The focal individual is not at the center of this scene, and Map Mode cannot be used if Use Compass is activated.</p></li>
<li><p>Global Settings: Feature that allows you to enter data that does not fit anywhere else, and data that acts as a modifier to the observation. Weather and health are examples. There is no study individual that is linked to this data. </p></li>
<li><p>Multimedia Comments: At the bottom of the scene, three buttons allow recording videos, photos, voice or written comments. All three are time stamped, and when written comments are saved, the GPS coordinate is also recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>Screen Off Options: If you wish to conserve power and turn your screen off in between scans, the app will send an alert when the scan time is approaching. The alert is timed for 20 seconds in advance and there is an optional warning sound along with it. If you have a GPS enabled watch, the alert can appear on the watch as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Upload/Download: Can send data to or from another device, either wirelessly or through a cable connection. Data is uploaded in .dat format. This feature also has a “Delete All Behavior Data” button which will wipe the device clean of any saved behavioral data. </p></li>
</ul>

</h3>

<p>We designed a small application names <strong>Animal Observer Toolbox</strong> to allow you to generate the <em>json</em> files needed to customize your user interface. You will need a recent version of the software R to be able to access this application. R can be downloaded <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">here</a>. Make sure R is installed on every computer you will use to set up Animal Observer and to download collected data. You will also need package 'shiny' to be installed. To do so, just type <code>install.packages('shiny')</code> in the R console.</p>

<p>You will need an internet connection the first time you run the toolbox. To launch it, just type:</p>

<pre><code>library(shiny)
runGitHub("FosseyFund/AOToolBox-public")
</code></pre>

<p>Necessary packages will then automatically be downloaded and the toolbox will start in your default internet browser. Follow the instructions in the different tabs to set up your user interface and convert the data you've collected to a set of csv files.</p>

<p>Once you've launched the Toolbox once using the above command, you can run it even without an internet access using the following procedure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the whole repository using the links at the top of the page. Unzip or untar it if you've downloaded it in a compressed format. You should obtain a folder named 'AOToolBox-master'.</li>
<li>Make sure R's working directory includes the AOToolBox folder.</li>
<li>Launch it from R by typing:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>library(shiny)
runApp('AOToolBox-master')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that although the <strong>Animal Observer Tool Box</strong> is fully functional, it is still in development. The tutorials will be improved, video demos will be included and additional features will be added. Ideas and feedback are welcome !</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
