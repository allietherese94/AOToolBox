### Convert data to csv

To convert this ".json" file into a set of ".csv" files:

* Upload the ".json" file you downloaded using the panel on the left. You must also upload the **"behaviors.json"** and **"layout_info.json"** files that were used in the app. 

* The data will then be automatically converted into readable ".csv" format and can be downloaded as tables using the "Download" buttons on the left panel. Et voilà!
